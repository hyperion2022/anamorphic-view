# Anamorphic View in Unity3D
Project by Mihai ANCA during the internship at LaBRI (22.05.2023 - 30.06.2023) under the supervision of Pascal DESBARATS.

I was tasked with implementing various 3D effects (static and dynamic anamorphosis, anaglyph and billboards) and using them in a 3D platformer game.

This repository contains the project itself, as well as various documents (including the scientific articles I've used) and the report I've submitted at the end of the internship documenting my work (in French).

In order to showcase it, I have created a platforming level in a week and a half using the anaglyph to create a duality between viewing the world normally and with the effect. Different objects spawn/despawn in order to create interesting puzzle possibilities. Four sets of cards need to be collected, then four corresponding challenges lead the way to corresponding symbols. Once all the symbols are collected, the game is won.
